# Introduction
This repo provides a Databricks Notebook and a Power BI report for analyzing the data from the [Indian Premier League (IPL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Premier_League), a professional cricket league in India. The data source is the [Cricsheet.org](https://cricsheet.org/matches/) website, which offers ball-by-ball IPL json data.

# Data Extraction, Loading and Transformation (ELT) with Databricks
The *Cricket IPL ELT Databricks* notebook performs the ELT process using Databricks, which fetches the IPL data from Cricsheet.org and creates the facts and dimensions tables based on the [Medallion Architecture](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/lakehouse/medallion), a best practice for building a lakehouse. You can run the notebook in [Databricks Community Edition](https://docs.databricks.com/getting-started/community-edition.html), a free version of Databricks.

# Data Visualization with Power BI
This repo also includes a *Cricket IPL Analysis.pbit* file that contains a Power BI report for visualizing the curated data from Databricks. To refresh the report, you need to enter the Databricks Cluster ID and Workspace ID (which you can find in the Databricks Cluster URL) as parameters after running the notebook in Databricks. You can also view the final report [here](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiNzEwNTEzNzktNDVkZS00YmQ2LTlkYWEtNTE4ZmQ2ZWRmMDFkIiwidCI6IjgxNDQwMDExLTVhZTQtNDhmNy1hY2YwLTg2ZjBkNWQ2YTFlMiJ9).
